Usage: checkclrs graphfile colorfile

This program checks each of the colors in colorfile to see if it is a correct
coloring of the graph in graphfile. For example, if using 
	generator graph
while generating the evacuation graph type, then the file graph.dcp
contains the hidden coloring and each of the completed deceptive colorings.

Then 
	checkclrs graph graph.dcp
will verify which of the colorings are correct. If the fraction of
undeleted edges is set to 0.0 then the hidden and all deceptive colorings
should be legal colorings. If fraction is set to 0.5 then only the 
hidden coloring should be correct (with high probability).

Smallk, iterated greedy and Culberson's other coloring programs typically
output colors in a format that can be verified by this program.
