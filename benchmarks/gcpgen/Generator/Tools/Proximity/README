For details on what this measure
does see the paper <a href="http://web.cs.ualberta.ca/~joe/Abstracts/ssrhp.html">
Hiding Our Color</a> Culberson, Beacham and Papp.

Basically, it measures the similarity between a set of colorings, with larger numbers meaning the
colorings are more similar. It does not verify correctness of the colorings.

Usage: proximity infile outfile numnodes mode colorlist
	infile - a set of colorings or partitions
	numndes - number of vertices; no graph is input
	mode  - either 1 or 2:
		1 = compare first coloring element by element to all other colorings
		2 = pairwise comparisons of all colorings in list(totals only)
	colorlist - list of colorings to be used
		if the first is < 1 then all colorings in infile used

Example:
	after generating a graph on 150 nodes
	using the evacuation type  with hidden and deceptive colorigns both
	at 15, running 

	proximity graph.dcp graph.prox 150 2 -1

	produced a file graph.prox with the following contents (best viewed on a wide terminal 120 columns)
